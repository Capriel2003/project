            <h2>Reading the Biochemical Exam</h2>
            <p>When performing an analysis flank on the reading of laboratory markers, it is essential, firstly, to emphasize that the results are delivered to the patient along with their respective reference values for each analyzed analyte. In this context, it is noteworthy that an analyte is the component of the sample obtained in the organism that acts as a marker of health and proper functioning of a specific organ or system.</p>
            <p>That way, a comparison is established between the patient's values for each marker in the analysis and their respective reference values, obtained from an average of values from a previously analyzed healthy population in similar conditions of sex, age, and ethnicity.</p>
            <p>In this context, it is observed that this analysis must be done by a specialized doctor who will take into consideration the individual's organism's latest values recorded for a particular analyte, using the individual variations in comparison to the recorded average, as well as potential interferents in biochemical tests such as medication usage and the patient's medical history.</p>
            <p>Among the medications that can alter biochemical values in your test, it is worth noting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paracetamol</li>
                <li>Acyclovir</li>
                <li>Amphotericin B</li>
                <li>Ampicillin</li>
                <li>Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)</li>
                <li>Acetylsalicylic acid</li>
                <li>Calcium</li>
                <li>Vitamin D</li>
                <li>Captopril</li>
                <li>Chloroquine</li>
                <li>Codeine</li>
                <li>Contraceptives</li>
            </ul>

        <p>EXAMPLE OF VALUES PROVIDED BY THE BIOCHEMICAL TEST/EXAM</p>

        <p>In this case, the value obtained from the patient’s sample falls within the reference standards, indicating a condition possibly within the normal range. This comparison would be carried out for all other values obtained as per the medical request, analyzing discrepancies in relation to the patient’s specific medical history.</p></section>
