            <h2>Technologies in Biomedicine</h2>
            <p>Technologies in Biomedicine are of paramount importance, both for clinical and laboratory practice. Through technologies, several processes have become more effective and diagnoses more accurate. It is worth highlighting that they can help from scheduling an online exam to optimizing time, as, through automated and agile processes, the team can provide better quality services.</p>
            <p>Many laboratories have state-of-the-art technologies; previously, much equipment was used manually. As time goes by, more diseases appear, with this, the large volume of exams also and consequently the demand for new research, through situations like these, the laboratories needed to be adapted with equipment that could meet great demands.</p>
            <p>Some exams such as the blood count are examples of technologies in Biomedicine. The Portuguese hospital (BA) has become a reference in automation; unlike many laboratories, the analysis is carried out in a fully automated way, and through cutting-edge equipment, it is possible to generate hematological reports.</p>
